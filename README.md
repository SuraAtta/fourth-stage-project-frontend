In our daily lives, mobile applications are becoming increasingly vital. These applications help peoples to accomplish different tasks anywhere by having only a mobile phone connected to the Internet. Online store applications are very popular these days. They allow peoples to search a massive number of different products and buying proper goods without need to leave their houses.
In this project we develop an open-source customizable online store application for Android phones that offers customers a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing products online. Features include product search, browsing, shopping cart management, with a light and dark mode. It also aims to provide an intuitive and efficient shopping experience, allowing customers to navigate easily and make purchases with just a few taps. Additionally, it provides a web application dashboard for the admin to control the application through adding, deleting, modifying items and have the ability of changing the applications logo and the themes color. 
When developing mobile applications, developers need to decide, either to develop multiple native applications for different operating systems or develop one app that is cross-platform compatible. Many technologies for creating cross-platform applications have emerged over the years. One such technology is Flutter. In this project, we used Flutter because of what it provides of cross-platform development and allow our application to work on both Android and IOS OSâ€™s.
